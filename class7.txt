CLASS #7

files: mean-session7/angular/index.html (branch: mean-session7done)

1. Intro
- topics: tidying things up, review project, animation project in Angular
- tip: use reveal js for presentation:
	=> it's done via css, not js
	=> you won't get the same speed using js
	=> great example of css animations
	=> need this to run Guardian github.com
- tip: Play framework:
	=> Java & Scala framework to build scalable web apps
- tip: image srcset:
	=> it leaves up to the device's browser to decide which image to show (small/medium/large)
	=> https://css-tricks.com/responsive-images-youre-just-changing-resolutions-use-srcset/
- tip: imagemagick:
	=> you can use free/open source tools like image magic to create different size images from a source image
	=> http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php
- tip: convention is to capitalize the Controller name in app.js
- $scope is the glue between the controller and the view
- in jQuery we always have to traverse/query the DOM to get to my element
- $scope is so much easier because it simply binds an area (view) to a JS function:
	=> and it's 2-way binding, meaning if the view changes the controller knows about it
	=> jQuery is 1-way binding
- difference btw ng-click vs ng-submit:
	=> ng-click: have to click that button to submit the form
	=> ng-submit: can hit Enter on any of the fields to submit the form
- border vs outline:
	=> border changes the elements width (unless you set the css property to border-box)
	=> outline does NOT change the width of the element (which is why it's popular/better)


2. Multiple controllers
- mean.pdf, page 49
- mean-session7/angular/index.html
- if a {{ something }} can't evalute, Angular just leaves it empty
- ng-include:
	=> came from html include (when you can include a chunk of html in another html page)
	=> this is the same thing but using the ng-include directive:
		<div style="float:right" ng-include="'app/partials/user_partial.html'"></div>
	=> helps you break up a large file (SPA) and break it up into multiple files
- ng-bind:
	=> how you bind something on the view to something on the controller


3. Angular route
- need to include a different js:
	<script src="https://code.angularjs.org/1.4.2/angular.min.js"></script>
	<script src="https://code.angularjs.org/1.4.2/angular-route.min.js"></script>
- you need to add the route to the app:
	var portfolioApp = angular.module('portfolioApp', ['ngRoute']);
- now i can say what we want to show when the url becomes something
	=> this is done via the .config() on the app
	=> config() is like an if-else statement
	=> what should happen if the URL is this or that
	=> this is how I say what to show when

	portfolioApp.config(function ($routeProvider) {
    	$routeProvider
 			.when("/portfolios", {								<== with this url ...
 				controller: "PortfolioListController",			<== ... use this controller ...
 				templateUrl: "app/partials/portfolios.html"})	<== .. and thiw view!
			.when("/", {
				redirectTo: "/portfolios"})						<== what to do on wakeup
 			.otherwise({ 
 				redirectTo: "/404_page" });						<== this is the catch all (default case)
			});
- when I do this, I need to remove the ng-controller from the html:
	=> it's now defined in app.config, not on the html!
- tip: it's a good practice to separate out each Controller, and even put them into app/controllers folder
- so Angular route is how you can break things up:
	=> specify what url uses what view and which controller
	=> we can remove the controller names from the html pages
	=> we can write the middlelayer: what goes where


4. Dynamic URLs
- on the root html:
    <a href="#/portfolio/{{portfolio.name}}">
        <span class="title" ng-bind="portfolio.title"></span>
    </a>
- now I have to setup the routing in app.js for this:
    .when("/portfolio/:portfolio_name", {
        controller: "PortfolioViewController",
        templateUrl: "app/partials/portfolio.html" })
- on the controller:
	portfolioApp.controller('PortfolioViewController', function( $scope, $routeParams ) {
		$scope.portfolio_name = $routeParams.portfolio_name;
	}
	=> $routeParams is how you get access to what's in the route
	=> $routeParams is how a controller can pass data to another
	=> now I can use the $scope.portfolio_name in both the Controller & the view
- to recap, for dynamic routing:
	=> on the root.html, add the dynamic link (eg: href="#/portfolio/{{portfolio.name}}")
	=> add routing to app.config() (with a new controller, eg: controller: "PortfolioViewController")
	=> create that new controller .js file
	=> include the new controller's .js file on index.html


5. CSS animation
- codrops: http://tympanus.net/codrops/
	=> great website for CSS effects
	=> esp strong on text input effects
- page transitions: great way to showcase CSS animation effects
- files: mean-session7/angular-structure
- mean.pdf, page 66
- on the controller, we are inserting a different pageClass for our views:
	=> this is a neat technique to differentiate quickly driving from the back
- now on the view I can do:
	<div class="page {{ pageClass }}" ng-view></div>
- angular-animate.js:
	=> adds & removes classes to facilitate animation, as you enter & leave a page
	=> see ngAnimate for full details
	=> angular does a better job w/ css animations than jQuery
- the classes that get added/removed via ngAnimate:
	=> ng-leave, ng-leave-active: on the outside element
	=> ng-enter, ng-enter-active: on the inside element
	=> ng-animate: what actually happens
- you can create and name your animation in css:
	/* rotate out */
	@keyframes rotateOutNewspaper {
	    to { transform: translateZ(-3000px) rotateZ(360deg); opacity: 0; }
	}
	=> this means the name 'rotateOutNewspaper' now does that transform
- now I can use this as an animation on another class:
	.page-404.ng-leave      {
	    transform-origin: 50% 50%;
	    animation: rotateOutNewspaper .5s both ease-in;
	}
	=> see animation.css for details


6. Homework
- add a form into your Midterm with error handling (using validation, ng-show etc)
	=> it doesn't have to actually save anything
- add the routing piece into your Midterm
- create the 404 page into your Midterm project
- get to a point where we are with our current views
- have a summary page & a details page (eg: portfolio of items)
