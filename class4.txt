CLASS #4

1. Intro
- good article: Bloomberg article: Paul Ford - What Is Code
- common issue is that you have the same variable in the global js namespace overwriting each other
- to avoid this, we need to use namespaces:
	=> var stevesApp = {};
	   stevesApp.person = "Steve";
- CodeKit: similar to Koala, but a better version of it (tho it costs $32)
	=> but does a lot more, eg: minimize JS as you go
	=> flag any JS issues by running js-lint on save
	=> you can preview your page on any mobile device
	=> same .scss preprocessing as Koala
- in order for a page to be responsive, you MUST INCLUDE the responsive meta tag
	=> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
	=> originally developed by Apple when they wanted app developers to only develop html apps
	=> all of your .html pages must include this meta tag to be responsive!
- in Bootstrap, the magic number is 12 (things always add up to 12)


2. Angular directives
- ng-init: generally don't use it, after version 1.3.0 you start seeing errors if using it
- ng-repeat: 
	=> by convention, you name the collection plural, eg: portfoliods
	=> by convention, you name the single element the same, eg: portfolio in portfolios
	=> you can run the ng-repeat thru filters & even more than one filter, example:
	<li ng-repeat="portfolio in portfolios | filter:searchFor | orderBy:'date'">{{ portfolio }}</li>
- you can use the regular JS methods, not just the json keys or Angular routines:
	=> {{ portfolios.length }} is simply the .length method on an Array
- ng-class:
	=> this is how you manipulate the class names that Angular injects into our page
- {{ $index }}: the database (or other) index of the thing we are repeating
- to simply dump what i have available for a single object:
	=> 	<li ng-repeat="(key, value) in portfolio">
			<strong>{{ key }}</strong> - {{ value }}
		</li>
- ng-src:
	=> use this instead of src in the <img> tag when you want to use an {{ expression }} in the src
	=> this is because there is a timing issue between when the browser loads the page & angular
	   loads in the image
	=> so use ng-src with images & expressions


3. Tips
- it's good to have a top right corner that shows you which break-point you are on currently:
	=> look at site/index.html: $(document).ready(function() is where the magic happens
