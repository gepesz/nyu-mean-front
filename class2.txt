1. Github basics 
- github: https://github.com/NYU-frontend/mean-session2.git
- README.md: the .md stands for mark down
- you can add multiple remote origins to a project
- GitUp: visual tool to see how a repo is changing

2. Design considerations
- mobile first = design concept that says you have a very small real estate space
- responsive   = another design concept that says you need to design for both mobile & web
- you cannot ever use fixed sizes for anything
- similarly, it's old school to use resolution dependent images, you use proper css for
  high resolution things
- user agent css = the css built into the browser
- sprite = an image that contains the hover/other version of the same image
- usually spites contain many small images
- the inspector shows the css files from most to least importance

3. Breakpoints
- breakpoints: this is how you design pages for resizing in mind
- a good design technique is to name your breakpoints as one, two, three:
	=> @break.one: 320px
	=> @break.two: 400px
	=> @break.three: 720px

4. Pseudo selectors
- pseudo selector: selects the state of something that doesn't exist
- eg: h3:before {  <= means what to do before the h3 element
	...
}
- you also have an :after pseudo
- you can show/hide things, etc

5. HTML basics
- tag = element, eg: div, h1
- attribute = property, eg: href
- there are 3 pillars to any page:
	a) CONTENT 				= HTML
	b) DESIGN/PRESENTATION 	= CSS
	c) BEHAVIOR 			= JAVASCRIPT
- <a href="img/pagoda.jpg" title="Pagoda in the forest"
	onclick="showPicOne(this); return false;">Pagoda</a>:
	=> here 'this' refers to the entire href tag
	=> you can print it out via console.log(whichPic);
	=> in showPicOne(), you must return false; otherwise
	   the event will bubble up & the browser will goto the image
- html ids are too powerful, used for programming (behavior) purposes
- when designing a page/ui, use only css classes
- most used DOM JavaScript routines:
	=> document.getElementById()
	=> element.getElementsByTagName()
	=> element.getAttribute()
	=> element.setAttribute()

6. jQuery
- api.jquery.com
- very powerful search functionality
