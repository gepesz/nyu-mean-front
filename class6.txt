CLASS #6

files: mean-session6/other/1 html5 forms/start.html

1. Intro
- diveintohtml5.info: good, quick, nice overview of HTML5
- tip: always clear the Console first!! (it keeps the old errors)
- use Angular version 1.x, not 2.x (too fresh)


2. HTML5
- pre-HTML5: you need to set 'type="text"' in an INPUT tag
	=> this is now old-school and "text" is the default value
- HTML5 added the 'placeholder' attribute to INPUT elements
	=> this is where you pre-populate the input field w/ grey text
- "required": another great HTML5 addition that's built into HTML5
	=> you can say 'required="true"' or just simply 'required' (preferred)
	=> also can apply to textarea
- these 2 pretty much should be added for every input element
- but in addition, HTML5 introduced new INPUT types:
	=> type="email":  this is really relevant on mobile, where the keyboard brought up will be the email keyboard!
	=> type="url":    similar to the "email" type: this brings up a URL keyboard on mobile
	=> type="number": with this type I can specify even more attributes:
		* min:  minimum value
		* max:  maximum value
		* step: the step size
	=> type="range":  similar to number, but this renders a slider:
		* min:  minimum value
		* max:  maximum value
		* step: the step size
	=> type="date":   renders a 'mm/dd/yyyy' date field, where I can tab between the parts
		* also has a built-in pop-up calendar
		* doesn't work in all browers (so we can't rely on it fully)
- forms & ols & uls always have padding in them, set padding: 0; to remove them
- *:focus: { 	<== this is how you set the property of the input element currently in focus
	outline: 
}

	input:focus, textarea:focus {
		box-shadow: 0 0 20px #ccc;	<== nice light grey border
		transform: scale(1.05);		<== pops out the in focus input field
	}

	input:not(:focus), textarea:not(:focus) {
		opacity: 0.5;				<== fields not in focus		
	}

- outline property is what you want to manipulate for focus, not 'border'!
- default font-size is still 16px on every browser by default
- the trend in fronts is to stack the labels on top of the input fields, due to mobile first:
	Name
	[input field]
	Email
	[input field]
	Website
	[input field]

	=> since INPUT fields are inline, you have to set display: inline-block; on both INPUT & TEXTAREA

- transform:  transforms a given DOM element (eg: scales it up, rotates, etc)
- transition: tells the input field to bring in the focus state slowly:
	=> transition: all 0.5s ease-in-out;	<== means show the 'transform' mode slowly, after 0.5 seconds!

- in addition to :focus, with HTML5 we have :required now:
	=> this is how you can style required fields!
	=> no need to add * or any other stuff on the HTML page itself
	=> input:required, textarea:required {
			background: #fff url(asterisk_orange.png) no-repeat 280px 6px;	<== put the asterisk image right on top of the input field!
	   }
- another thing is the :valid state:
	=> what to do with the input field when it passes validation, eg:
		input:valid, textarea:valid {
			background: #fff url(tick.png) no-repeat 280px 6px;		
		}
- and of curse there is the :invalid state as well:
	=> the problem is that this is shown on wakeup (overwrites the :required state)
	=> input:invalid, textarea:invalid {
			background: #fff url(cancel.png) no-repeat 280px 6px;		
	   }
	=> a field is in INVALID state until it's VALID (it's either/or)
	=> so the form does wake-up in invalid state
	=> better to use the :required state instead

- input[type="submit"] { ... }: this is how I can select a certain type of a field
	=> element[attribute="value"] is the standard form to style what I want
- you can also style the 'placeholder':
	::-webkit-input-placeholder {
		color: blue;
	}
- add 'autofocus' as an attribute into the first INPUT field (to have it automatically focused on page load)
- you can also chain states together, eg:
	input:focus:invalid, textarea:focus:invalid {
		background: #fff url(cancel.png) no-repeat 280px 6px;		
	}
	=> this is how you should use the :invalid state!

- how to set autocorrection to off:
	=> autocorrect="off"
- similarly you can disable auto capitalization:
	=> autocapitalize="off"

- novalidate: you can turn off validation altogether for a form with this attribute:
	=> 	<form name="" action="" novalidate> 


3. Modernizr
- it's a feature detection utility
- based on what browser you are on, it creates different things
- so for example, it brings in a bunch of html classes (eg: 'no-touch', 'rgba', etc)
- the old-school way was browser sniffing:
	=> this is how you got things done for different browsers
- with feature detection, you do the opposite: check what is available to me on the given browser
- so how can I detect if something is supported:
	<script type="text/javascript">
		if (!Modernizr.touch) {
			console.log("no touch");
		}
		if (!Modernizr.inputtypes.date) {
			console.log("no date");
		}
	</script>
- Modernizr adds 2 things to a page:
	=> Modernizr javascript object (where I can query supported & unsupported features in JS):
		if (!Modernizr.touch) {
			// I am on a device that supports touch
		}
	=> inserts a bunch of classes onto the html tag:
			* <html class=" js flexbox opacity ..."
			* this is so that I can add conditional CSS:
				form { /* general form style */ }	<== every browser should style forms like this
				.opacity form { /* this is where I add opacity to my forms for those browers that support it! */ }
				^^^ this is progressive enhancement: browsers that support opacity should add additional styling to the form!

- so using Modernizr you can take advantage of modern technologies while still supporting old ones
- typically you don't need the entire Modernizr, but rather a small version of it
- these days people write their own Modernizr's, for example: The Guardian
- theguardian.com:
	=> github.com/guardian/frontend: the entire frontend is up on github!
	=> many ppl use it as the golden benchmark to compare themselves to
- nytimes.com:
	=> a lot larger nof classes on the HTML element
- what people really use Modernizr for is managing the local cache (data) that the site can use:
	=> you can close the browser and re-open it in the same state!
	=> so the website really becomes like a desktop application then


4. Philosophies
- progressive enhancement: means you can use what the browser supports today, using feature detection
- regressive enhancement: means the opposite: writing code to support an old browser (which everybody hates to do)
- progressive enhancement is the way to go
- graceful degredation: means to maintain a limited functionality even tho almost everything has already been deprecated
	=> a simple way to deal with a total catastrophy
	=> this is how you deal with very old browsers


5. jQueryUI
- jqueryui.com: set of UI animations/widgets/etc built on top of jQuery
- for example, I can add the date picker to Safari using this


6. Angular form validation
	<form name="add_portfolio_form" action="" novalidate>
		<p>Is this form valid? {{ add_portfolio_form.date.$valid }}</p>		<== simple true/false check
		<p>Is this form invalid? {{ add_portfolio_form.date.$invalid }}</p>	<== simple true/false check
		<p>Is this form errored? {{ add_portfolio_form.date.$error }}</p>	<== JSON object: state of each attribute set on the field

		<input type="text" placeholder="yyyy/mm/dd" size="10" ng-model="adding_portfolio.date" ng-required="true" ng-minlength="10" name="date"/>

	</form>
- ng-required: the Angular equivalent of the 'required' attribute
- ng-minlength: the Angular equivalent of 'minlength'
- these ng-required, ng-minlength etc attributes build/remove css classes to/from the INPUT elements dynamically
- just like Modernizr, Angular inserts a bunch of classes onto the form itself:
	=> ng-pristine
	=> ng-invalid
	=> ng-invalid-required
	=> tons more
- in fact, each of these classes are added dynamically onto the INPUT fields as I type into them!
- so both on the input fields & the entire form I keep track of my state via dynamic class names
- this is how I can style them
- ng-show: you can show or hide an element based on some state:
	<div class="alert alert-danger" ng-show="add_portfolio_form.date.$invalid">
		Date too short
	</div>
	=> ng-show is a very important feature
- but we really want to run the validation on the entire form when the button is clicked
	<div class="alert alert-danger" ng-show="add_portfolio_error">
		{{ add_portfolio_error }}
	</div>


7. Homework
- https://github.com/NYU-frontend/mean-session6, Assignment section
- implement the 'Add a Portfolio' form on top of the pirate page
- add validation, using Angular
- use ng-disabled on the button
- use a later version of Angular to get things working
